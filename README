 ** EventMachine Async Bloc ** 

Massively simplify EventMachine code, especially in server-type apps by introducing
blocks of "procedural" in a green-thread-like manner, on top of eventmachine.

Bourne mainly from frustration with dealing with callbacks / errbacks within callbacks
it does simulate thread-like behaviour, except "thread" interruption occurs only when
you enter a pseudo blocking (evented) function call. Hence you don't have to go nuts
writing thread-safe data-structures as long as you're reasonably sensible about how
you use them.

Also, it meant I'd actually used callcc for something!

Bonus points for adding detail here.
